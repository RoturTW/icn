# Weight

In icn you can set the pen width of the subsequent rendering using the `w` command

## w 10

Setting the size to 10 makes the line thick!

```javascript
w 10
line -10 -10 10 10
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" width="225"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## w 2

We can use a smaller line weight by simply using a smaller number

```javascript
w 2
line -10 -10 10 10
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt="" width="225"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you can see, the line weight affects the width of the line, allowing you to make more intricate icons using different levels of weight.
