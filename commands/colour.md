# Colour

You can set the colour of all subsequent lines to be drawn using the command `c`

```
c #hexcode
```

You use the command to set the colour of specific parts of the icon

```javascript
c #555
line 10 10 -10 -10
c #fff
cont 10 -10
```

This draws two connected lines with a darker colour and a lighter colour
